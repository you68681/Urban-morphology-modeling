# Urban-morphology-modeling

This project explores the entire process of dynamic urban modelling based on Urban
morphology theory. A specific area of Tmor Da located in Phnom Penh was modeled
by the Gama modeling platform and the Agent-based model. The analysis of the
combined technologies of ABM and GIS is to conduct a feasibility analysis for the
entire project. At the same time, this project explains how to handle GIS files in Gama
in detail.
